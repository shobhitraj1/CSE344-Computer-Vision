# CSE344-Computer-Vision

ðŸ“˜ **Course Overview:** <br>
This repository contains my coursework (assignments, &amp; semester exams) for the [Computer Vision](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE344) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2025. <br>
The course explores visual recognition tasks (classification, segmentation, object detection with YOLO), image formation, multi-view geometry (stereo, epipolar), camera calibration, image processing techniques (keypoint detection & matching), and advanced topics like GAN-based image generation and vision-language models.

ðŸ“‚ **Folder Structure:**
- `/Assignment 1`: Performed image classification, segmentation, and multi-object detection/tracking on real-world datasets.
- `/Assignment 2`: Implemented camera calibration using chessboard images, panorama stitching, and 3D point cloud registration.
- `/Assignment 3`: Applied pretrained vision-language models like CLIP, BLIP, and LAVT for VQA, captioning, and referring segmentation.
- `/Assignment 4`: Implement DCGAN and StyleGAN for high-quality image generation. <i>Not Attempted</i>.
- `/Quizzes`: Contains materials related to the quizzes.
- `/Midsem`: Contains materials related to the midterm examination.
- `/Endsem`: Contains materials related to the endterm examination.
- `/Project`: Coming soon.

ðŸ“… **Semester:**
6th Semester (3rd Year)
